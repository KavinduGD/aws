# 🔐 AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

IAM is the AWS service that controls:

- **Who** can access your AWS account.
- **What** they can do.
- **Which** resources they can access.
- **From where** and under what conditions.

Think of IAM as the **security guard + permission manager** of your AWS account.

## 🧠 Why IAM Exists (Core Problem It Solves)

When you create an AWS account, you get a **Root User** with full admin access. Using the root user daily is dangerous. IAM allows you to:

- Create granular users.
- Create roles for services.
- Attach specific permissions.
- Enforce the **Principle of Least Privilege**.

---

## 🏗 Core IAM Components

IAM has 5 main building blocks:

### 👤 1. IAM Users

Represents a person or an application (e.g., `Kavindu`, `CI/CD bot`).

- **Username/Password**: For AWS Console access.
- **Access Keys**: For CLI/API access (`Access Key ID` & `Secret Access Key`).
- ⚠️ **Security Note**: Never share or commit secret keys.

### 👥 2. IAM Groups

A collection of users. Instead of assigning permissions to individuals, you attach a policy to a group and add users to it.

- _Example_: `DevOps-Team`, `Developers`, `ReadOnlyUsers`.

### 🎭 3. IAM Roles

A role is **not** a user. It is a set of permissions that can be **assumed temporarily** by:

- AWS Services (e.g., EC2, Lambda).
- Users from other AWS accounts.
- External identities (SAML/OIDC).

**Example: EC2 Accessing S3**
Instead of storing keys on the server, attach a role to the EC2 instance. It uses temporary, automatically rotated credentials.

### 📜 4. IAM Policies

Policies define permissions using **JSON** format.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Policy Structure

| Field         | Meaning                                       |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **Effect**    | `Allow` or `Deny`                             |
| **Action**    | The specific operation (e.g., `s3:GetObject`) |
| **Resource**  | The AWS resource ARN the action applies to    |
| **Condition** | (Optional) When the policy is in effect       |

---

## 🧮 IAM Policy Evaluation Logic

1. **Explicit Deny**: If any policy says "Deny", the request is denied immediately.
2. **Explicit Allow**: If there is an "Allow" and no "Deny", the request is allowed.
3. **Default Deny**: If neither exists, the request is denied by default.

## 🔐 IAM Best Practices

- ✅ **Never use the Root User** for daily tasks.
- ✅ **Enable MFA** (Multi-Factor Authentication) for all users.
- ✅ **Use Roles** for EC2 and other services instead of long-term Access Keys.
- ✅ **Apply Least Privilege**: Grant only the minimum permissions required.
- ✅ **Rotate Access Keys** regularly.
- ✅ **Use IAM Policy Simulator** to test permissions.

## 🔥 Advanced Concepts

- **IAM Trust Policy**: Defines _who_ is allowed to assume a role.
- **Cross-Account Access**: Allowing Account A to access resources in Account B.
- **Permission Boundaries**: Sets the maximum permissions an identity can have.
- **Service Control Policies (SCP)**: Organization-level guardrails that limit permissions across accounts.

## 🏢 Users with Role-Based Access

**Workflow:**

1. Create IAM Users.
2. Create IAM Roles with a **Trust Relationship** allowing users to assume them.
3. Attach **Permissions Policies** to the roles.
4. Users **Assume the Role** to perform specific tasks.

## Turn on multi-session support

Traditionally, if you tried to log into a second AWS account in a new tab, AWS would automatically log you out of the first one. This forced users to use "Incognito" windows or different browsers to work on Dev and Prod simultaneously.

Key Features of Multi-Session Support:

- Up to 5 Sessions: You can stay signed into up to five different AWS identities (Root user, IAM user, or Federated roles) at once.
- Single Browser: No more switching between Chrome, Firefox, and Incognito mode just to see two different accounts.
- Unique Subdomains: Once enabled, AWS changes your URL to include a session-specific prefix (e.g., https://123456789012.console.aws.amazon.com...). This "isolates" the tab so the browser knows which credentials to use for which page.
- Easy Switching: After you turn it on, a new "Add session" button appears in that same menu, allowing you to log into another account without losing your current one.
