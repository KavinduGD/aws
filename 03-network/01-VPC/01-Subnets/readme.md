**A bastion host (also known as a jump server) is a special-purpose server designed to act as a secure gateway between an external network (like the internet) and an internal network.**

- **A bastion host serves as a controlled entry point for administrators to securely connect to internal resources (e.g., EC2 instances, databases, or private subnets).**
