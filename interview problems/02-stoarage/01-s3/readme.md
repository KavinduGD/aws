# Amazon S3 Interview Questions

## 1. What is Amazon S3?

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service provided by Amazon Web Services.

**It is used to store:**
- Files
- Images
- Backups
- Logs
- Static websites
- Application data

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Highly durable:** 11 9’s durability.
- **Scalable:** Handles virtually unlimited data.
- **Managed:** No servers to manage.

## 2. What is an S3 Bucket?

A bucket is a container for storing objects.
- **Bucket** → Folder (top level)
- **Object** → File
- **Naming:** Bucket names must be **globally unique**.

## 3. What is an Object in S3?

An object consists of:
- **Data:** The file content.
- **Key:** The full path/name of the file.
- **Metadata:** Key-value pairs describing the object.
- **Version ID:** Unique identifier if versioning is enabled.

*Note: S3 stores data as objects, not blocks.*

## 4. What is the difference between S3 and EBS?

| Feature | S3 | EBS |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Type** | Object storage | Block storage |
| **Use Case** | Files, backups, static assets | EC2 root volumes, databases |
| **Access** | Via API / HTTP | Attached to a single EC2 instance |
| **Scalability** | Highly scalable | Limited to volume size/instance |

## 5. What are S3 Storage Classes? (storage classes are added to objects, not to buckets)

Different cost tiers used to optimize storage expenses:
- **S3 Standard:** Frequent access.
- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering:** Automatic cost savings for changing access patterns.
- **S3 Standard-IA:** Infrequent access, lower storage cost, higher retrieval cost.
- **S3 One Zone-IA:** Lower cost, but data is stored in a single AZ.
- **S3 Glacier:** Archive data (minutes to hours retrieval).
- **S3 Glacier Deep Archive:** Long-term archive (12-48 hours retrieval).

## 6. What is S3 Versioning?

Versioning keeps multiple versions of an object in the same bucket.
- Protects from accidental deletion or overwrites.
- Enables rollback to previous versions.
- **Delete Marker:** Deleting an object creates a marker rather than permanent removal.

## 7. What is S3 Lifecycle Policy?

Lifecycle rules automatically manage objects to reduce costs:
- **Transition:** Move objects to cheaper storage (e.g., Standard to Glacier after 30 days).
- **Expiration:** Delete old files automatically (e.g., delete logs after 365 days).

## 8. What is S3 Bucket Policy?

A **Bucket Policy** is a JSON-based access control policy attached directly to a bucket.
- Defines who (principals) can access the bucket and what actions they can perform.
- Common uses: Making a bucket public or restricting access to specific IAM roles.

When do we use a Bucket Policy?
- We use a Bucket Policy when we want to control access at the bucket level.

Common cases:

- Allow public access to a bucket
- Allow access from another AWS account
- Allow only specific IP addresses
- Allow access from a specific service (like CloudFront)

## 9. What is the difference between IAM Policy and Bucket Policy?

- **IAM Policy:** Attached to a User, Group, or Role. Defines **who** can access which AWS resources.
- **Bucket Policy:** Attached to the Bucket. Defines **what** entities can access this specific bucket.

## 10. What is a Pre-signed URL?

A temporary access link generated by the backend that allows users to upload or download objects without needing AWS credentials.
- It expires after a set duration.
- Used for secure, time-limited access.

## 11. How is S3 data secured?

- **Access Control:** IAM policies, Bucket policies, and Access Control Lists (ACLs).
- **Encryption at Rest:** SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or SSE-C.
- **Encryption in Transit:** Enforced via HTTPS (TLS).
- **Block Public Access:** A bucket-level setting to prevent accidental public exposure.

## 13. What is S3 Static Website Hosting?

S3 can host static content (HTML, CSS, JS).
- **Steps:** Enable static hosting, upload files, and configure index/error documents.
- **Note:** S3 does not support server-side scripting (PHP, Python, etc.).

## 14. What is S3 Event Notification?

S3 can trigger automated workflows when specific events occur (e.g., `ObjectCreated`, `ObjectRemoved`).
- **Targets:** AWS Lambda, SNS (Simple Notification Service), SQS (Simple Queue Service).

## 15. What is S3 Replication?

- **Cross-Region Replication (CRR):** Replicates data to a bucket in a different AWS region.
- **Same-Region Replication (SRR):** Replicates data within the same region.
- Used for disaster recovery, compliance, and latency reduction.

## 16. What is Multipart Upload?

A mechanism to upload large files in parts, which are then reassembled by S3.
- Improves upload speed (parallelism) and reliability (retry individual parts).
- Recommended for files > 100 MB; required for files > 5 GB.

## 17. What is S3 Transfer Acceleration?

Uses AWS Edge Locations and the AWS global network to speed up data transfers into S3.
- Useful for users uploading large files from different geographical locations.

## 19. How would you use S3 in a DevOps pipeline?

- **Artifact Storage:** Store build binaries and ZIP files.
- **Terraform State:** Store remote state files with locking.
- **Logging:** Centralized storage for VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail, and App logs.
- **Static Hosting:** Deploying frontend SPAs (React, Vue).

## 20. When should you NOT use S3?

Do NOT use S3 for:
- **Operating Systems:** Use EBS (Block Storage).
- **High-frequency Database Storage:** Use RDS or DynamoDB.
- **Dynamic Content:** S3 only hosts static files.
- **Like a network drive**

## 21. Comparison: S3 vs. EBS vs. EFS

| Feature | S3 (Object Storage) | EBS (Block Storage) | EFS (File Storage) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Use Case** | Static files, backups, assets | OS volumes, databases | Shared files, home dirs |
| **Access** | Internet / API (HTTPS) | One EC2 at a time | Multiple EC2s (NFS) |
| **Scalability** | Virtually unlimited | Manual resizing | Elastic (auto-scales) |
| **Analogy** | Web-based storage | Internal Hard Drive | Network Drive |


## 22. When to use S3 vs EFS (Simple)

Use S3 when:

- Storing files like images, videos, backups
- Need internet access
- No need to attach to EC2
- Want low-cost storage

Use EFS when:

- Multiple EC2 need shared storage
- Applications need a shared file system
- Need file-level access (like Linux folders)
